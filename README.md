# -2D-hydraulic_fracture_simulation
2D Hydraulic Fracturing Simulation using Python. The reservoir is modeled as a grid where injection pressure diffuses using a finite-difference approach. Fractures initiate when pressure exceeds a critical threshold. The project visualizes fracture growth and tracks pressure evolution over time. Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
